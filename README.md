# Custom-Video-Dataset-in-PyTorch
Notes about usage:  This code is to create a custom video dataset to train deeplearning models  using PyTorch on consecutive video frames extracted from a video. This code expects the extracted video frames in separate folders. For example, video1's frames will be in a folder named 'video1'. You can use OpenCV to extract video frames and save inside folders.
